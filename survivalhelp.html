        <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When your world finishes loading, you will find yourself in a dangerous world full of hostile creatures. To defend yourself, you will need to gather some basic materials like wood and stone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wood is relatively easy to collect as tree biomes are common so you would've likely spawned near a forest of some sort. Find the nearest tree and chop it down with your hands and, if it is flowering, collect it's fruit.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h2>Crafting</h2>
        <p>Open your inventory and place the wood you collected in the centre slot of your crafting grid. Every block of wood gives you 4 planks; craft 20 planks and place them in your inventory.</p>
        <p>Retrieve a plank from your inventory and place it in the centre slot of your crafting grid. This will give you 4 sticks per plank; craft 8 sticks and place them into your inventory.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Now that you have made some basic items, you can move on to crafting a pickaxe. Follow the image below to craft a wooden pickaxe, then dig into the side of a mountain or hill to get some stone whilst creating a cave in the process. Mine any coal you find too, as this can be used to make torches.</p>

        <p>Coal can also be used as fuel for your furnace, just place it in the bottom slot to cook the item in the top slot. Common sources of food include the Hungry mob which drops green jelly upon death, and the sheep which drops raw meat that can be cooked for more hunger point gain.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc">And that's how you start your first world! The world is now yours to explore and thrive in, and it gets even better with friends.</p>
